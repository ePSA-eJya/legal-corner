# Legal Corner

This project is a website for a law firm that tends to help users fix appointments with a lawyer. It will keep an update on the case and create transparency between the client and the lawyer. The website is still in a beginner form and needs to be worked upon. Basic frontend work has been done until now.
I aim to attach the backend to make the website fully functional.

Clone the repo on your local machine.
